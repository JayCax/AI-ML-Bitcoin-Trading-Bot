# how to create the requirements file:
    # activate the conda enviroment you want to use.
    # cd to the directory you want to put the requirements file.
    # run this command: conda list -e > requirements.txt
    # comment out # gym requirement

# how to run the requirements file:
    # go to conda (base) by running: conda deactivate
    # run this command: conda config --append channels conda-forge
    # cd to directory with requirements file
    # create your new environment: conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt
        # example: conda create --name CryptoBot --file requirements.txt
        # Note, this may take a while because we have so many requirements
    # Activate enviroment, install pip to conda if necessary
    # Finally, pip install gym==0.26.1
